## Motivation

University course registration aid is almost non-existent, there is currently zero applications that provide clear and productive assistance to Technion students with their academic degrees. Students often struggle to organize their weekly calendars and avoid courses overlap, their set of academic courses, or which courses to take each semester, how to find relavent courses easily, track prerequisites, calculate gpa and more.
Hence, DegreEZ was built to remove that stress and give students the clarity and control they deserve — with a smart schedule, a customizable diagram for all the courses they took, and clear progress tracking, plus the perks of AI agents services.
