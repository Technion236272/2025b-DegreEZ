# DegreEZ

DegreEZ is a smart academic planner for university students. It helps students visualize their schedules, track progress toward graduation, and receive AI-powered course suggestions — all in one simple, personalized app.

## Motivation

University course registration is often messy: students struggle to track prerequisites, avoid schedule overlaps, and understand their degree requirements. Even after registering, it’s hard to monitor overall progress — how many credits are done, how many are left, or whether your GPA is on track.
DegreEZ was built to remove that stress and give students the clarity and control they deserve — with a smart schedule, a customizable diagram, clear progress tracking, and AI that works for them.
